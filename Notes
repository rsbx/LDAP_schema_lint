Assumption:
	There is only 1 namespace for oids.
	This is correct as far as it goes; however, the different schema
		element types use the first component OID to mean different
		things.  e.g. The objectclasses and attributetypes schema
		element types use the first component OID as an identifier
		for type being defined; and the matchingruleuse and
		ditcontentrules schema element types use the first component
		OID to identify the schema element to be augmented.

		AttributeType, MatchingRule, MatchingRuleUse, DITContentRule,
		DITStructureRule, NameForm) is a separate namespace.

	Names are prefered over oids.
