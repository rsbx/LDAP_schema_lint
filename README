schema_lint is a static LDAP schema checker.

It only checks that the LDAP schema is itself is complete and standards
compliant; it does not check directory contents against the schema.

To use it, execute it with a list of schema source files as the command
arguments.  The contents of each file should be the schema specification
attributes in LDIF format; unrecognized content is ignored.  The "schema"
directory has some samples to experiment with.
